career spanning more than 50 years he has worked primarily in Africa and the
southern hemisphere on national airborne survey programmes. For 20 years he was
Professor in Exploration Geophysics at ITC in Delft, teaching and supervising
graduate students from the region. He then returned to consulting on

for international agencies supporting governments in Africa. He has been based
successively in Botswana, UK, Canada, Australia and The Netherlands. He has
lectured widely on regional geophysical exploration, was Association
Lecturer for IAGA in 2009, AAPG Distinguished Lecturer in Europe in 2011 and

and interpretation’. Since 2017 he has been a member of the Geological
Society’s Stratigraphy Commission. In his retirement he endeavours to share
his unique insights and experience to realise their scientific value to
studies of Gondwana and its dispersal.
