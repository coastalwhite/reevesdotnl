Earthworks was founded in 2001 as a vehicle for Colin’s consulting activities.
Many projects have involved the supervision and interpretation of airborne
geophysical mapping programmes in Uganda, Madagascar, Nigeria and Malawi for the
World Bank and other agencies. The company has also consulted for oil majors in
regional exploration strategies in Africa and India. Since 2018 the work has
concentrated on an integrated study of Gondwana dispersal and its relevance to
the energy sector and supporting the new Geological Map of Gondwana (IGCP-628).
’Global thinking in exploration geoscience’ encapsulates the ambition of
Earthworks to set exploration projects in their global tectonic context from a
scientific standpoint as well as to realise the potential of the earth sciences
in the strategic economic development of emerging economies in Africa and
elsewhere.
