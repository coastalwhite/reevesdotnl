<!-- About cards -->
<div class="card content">
    Colin Reeves is an earth scientist specialised in geophysical mapping. In a
    career spanning more than 50 years he has worked primarily in Africa and the
    southern hemisphere on national airborne survey programmes. For 20 years he
    was Professor in Exploration Geophysics at ITC in Delft, teaching and
    supervising graduate students from the region. He then returned to
    consulting on country-wide aeromagnetic survey programmes designed to
    explore hidden geology for international agencies supporting governments in
    Africa. He has been based successively in Botswana, UK, Canada, Australia
    and The Netherlands. He has lectured widely on regional geophysical
    exploration, was Association Lecturer for IAGA in 2009, AAPG Distinguished
    Lecturer in Europe in 2011 and winner of the Best Paper award at the PESGB
    ‘Africa’ meeting in London in 2015. His publications include ‘Aeromagnetic
    surveys: principles, practice and interpretation’. Since 2017 he has been a
    member of the Geological Society’s Stratigraphy Commission. In his
    retirement he endeavours to share his unique insights and experience to
    realise their scientific value to studies of Gondwana and its dispersal.

<!-- Earthworks card -->
<div class="card content">
    Earthworks was founded in 2001 as a vehicle for Colin’s consulting
    activities. Many projects have involved the supervision and interpretation
    of airborne geophysical mapping programmes in Uganda, Madagascar, Nigeria
    and Malawi for the World Bank and other agencies. The company has also
    consulted for oil majors in regional exploration strategies in Africa and
    India. Since 2018 the work has concentrated on an integrated study of
    Gondwana dispersal and its relevance to the energy sector and supporting the
    new Geological Map of Gondwana (IGCP-628).  ’Global thinking in exploration
    geoscience’ encapsulates the ambition of Earthworks to set exploration
    projects in their global tectonic context from a scientific standpoint as
    well as to realise the potential of the earth sciences in the strategic
    economic development of emerging economies in Africa and elsewhere.
