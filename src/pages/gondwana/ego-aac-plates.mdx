## Break-up of the plates of East Gondwana

![How India first broke out of Gondwana](http://www.reeves.nl/upload/ego-3-gifmaker.gif)

In our Gondwana reassembly, India and Madagascar are surrounded closely on three sides by Africa, Antarctica and Australia.  How can India and Madagascar escape from such a situation without offending against basic rules of plate tectonics, such as overlap of fragments, while following the evidence of oceanic fracture zones and magnetic anomalies as well as any relevant geological observations?  The options are very limited, suggesting that any fully acceptable solution is unique.  The rationale behind our latest solution is set out in Research Update No.19 and illustrated in the figures given there. The animation above is derived from these figures and the Euler rotations are given under ‘Recent rotations’ for the model CR22BBBI.
