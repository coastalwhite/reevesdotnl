## Retracing Ocean Fracture Zones


Where mid-ocean ridges are offset by transforms, the extinct (aseismic) section of the transform are left behind, growing stadily as the pair of conjugate continents
retreat from the mid-ocean ridge.  If we wish to reconstruct the paleo-positions of the continents we have to honour this process and retrace extinct fracture zones by 
telescoping them into each other, reversing the process of their creation.
