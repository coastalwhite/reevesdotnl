**Abstract**

The fragmentary release of petroleum data defining the deep structure and stratigraphy of African basins, has been integrated with the existing literature to enable the compilation of 19 tectonic maps over key geological intervals from Permian to Recent times. African plate margins range in their age of opening from Late Triassic (off Lebanon), through Early/Mid Jurassic (Eastern Mediterranean, Central Atlantic, Somali Basin) to ongoing (northern Red Sea). Their opening follows propagational trends, e.g. from the Eastern Mediterranean to Guinea, and from the Somali Basin in a ‘smile’ shape around southern Africa, eventually to Guinea. Just under half of the margin correspond to the rifted margin model. North Africa margins are controlled initially by transforms, while volcanic rifted margins dominate in southern Africa. The poorest controlled bounding ocean, the Eastern Mediterranean, is shown through well and seismic interpretations to have commenced spreading in late Early to early Middle Jurassic times. Much of West African Cretaceous tectonics, including the generation of multiple transform systems, are caused by the counter-rotation of Africa versus South America initiated by South Atlantic opening, itself linked to the Bouvet Plume. From the Aptian onwards, Africa receives a series of transpressional shocks, largely derived from the Tethyan margin. The most pronounced such event occurs in the Santonian, which seems to be a global scale event, with events in the Indian and Atlantic Ocean also affecting parts of Africa. Africa is segmented by many interior rifts, with these developed on all mapped intervals, though with peaks of activity in the Permian (South Africa), Late Triassic (North Africa), Early Cretaceous (Central Africa) and Neogene (East Africa). In the Early Cretaceous, a stress regime is imposed which creates a series of NW-SE trending rifts across the plate: this switches gradually to a N-S rift trend in the Cenozoic. Passive rifts show a high degree of inheritance and can be orientated both perpendicular and parallel to associated transforms. The passive, usually transform related, category of rifts dominates in the Mesozoic, with active plume-related rifts such as the East African Rift System dominant in the Cenozoic. Analogue-driven hypotheses are proposed for the origin of the more poorly controlled African rifts, such as the Western Desert of Egypt. The formation of the various elements of petroleum systems are responses to these tectonics. For example, patterns of basin restriction and potential anoxia are seen to follow the propagational marine transgressive trends associated with continental breakup.
