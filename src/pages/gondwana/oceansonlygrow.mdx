## Rapid progress in the Early Cretaceous

![Oceans Only Grow](http://www.reeves.nl/upload/OnlyGrow150-85-gifmaker-50.gif)

Plate tectonics recognises only three types of plate margin: (1) *rifts* and *ridges* that create new crust by extension, (2) *transforms* where two plates slide past
each other and (3) *subduction zones* where crustal material gets consumed back into the mantle.  The threshold for starting a subduction zone is high and such
features hardly appear in the dispersal story of central Gondwana. It follows that every plate margin we model in Gondwana dispersion must be either type (1) or type
(2). This leads to a further test that any acceptable model must pass: *the growth of an ocean must be more-or-less smoothly continuous unless there is good evidence
to the contrary.* In particular 'growth' must not go into reverse, implying that new crust was being consumed.  There may be instances, particularly in young or 
proto-oceans, where local evidence of compression may be found (e.g. flower structures on seismic setcions) but even here the amount of shortening will be small on the 
scale of a global map. For the rest, once started, a rift turning into an ocean will show an increase in oceanic area with time. 

We can test models against this criterion by drawing a median line down each incipient ocean at regular time intervals and copying it to each of the two conjugate
fragments. After a time, these two features will have separated and a new median can be drawn. The spacing between consecutive lines should not vary greatly. The
animation illustrates the result of such an exercise for our latest Gondwana dispersion model. The 140 Ma median line, the first in Cretaceous times, is red and marks
the onset of many new margins of dispersal activity. Spectral colours follow at intervals of 5 myr until 105 Ma (magenta). From the 100 Ma median line we use grey
median lines and stop at 85 Ma, by which time India has taken off from Madagascar. 

Note in the animation that, in the relatively short time interval 135 to 120 Ma approximately (orange-yellow-green-pale blue median lines), many of the outlines of the
southern continents are established and (slow) rifting turns into (normal) ocean growth rates that continue - in many cases to the present day. By about 100 Ma and the
end of the Early Cretaceous the new ridge system becomes continuous all the way from West Africa to Australia.  The old-established spreading between Africa and
Antarctica carries on undiminished after a new location of the Bouvet triple junction is established at about 129 Ma.  The Bouvet plume remains centrally situated
between Africa and Antarctica throughout. Note particularly that the rapid growth of the Weddell Sea after 142.3 Ma slows markedly at about M0 time (121.4 Ma).  The
position of the South America plate is such that, even here, ocean growth remains slightly positive, changing to a largely strike-slip role towards the end of the time
shown in the animation.
