## Africa and Antarctica, Gondwana's largest plates

Our model places events off SE Africa above the Bouvet mantle plume throughout Jurassic and Cretaceous times. From break-up until about 125 Ma, published marine magnetic anomalies
define the relative positions of Antarctica and Africa very closely. We use the continuity of fractures zones across the active mid-ocean ridge as well as constraints from events in the surrounding Gondwana fragments
to interpolate positions from M0 (121.4 Ma, GTS2020) to C34 (83.64 Ma). The transfer of Limpopia (Limp) from Antarctica to Africa and of the Maurice Ewing Bank (MEB) from Africa to South America
leads to a new triple junction position south of the Mozambique Rise (Limp) at about 129 Ma. We interpret its position (yellow plate corners with heavy black outlines) from ocean-floor 
topography and marine magnetic anomalies.  Note the onset of rapid spreading in the Weddell Sea at the start of the Cretaceous (142.3 Ma) with the westward movement of the Malvinas Plateau and Falkland Islands.
