Two new animations of continental movements are approaching completeness. __South
Atlantic Ocean__

The first of these is an animation of the development of the South Atlantic
Ocean to accompany an  invited paper in the __Journal of African Earth
Sciences.__ The animation may be viewed and  downloaded here but is subject to revision
during the review process. 

# Bouvet Mantle Plume 

The second animation attempts to describe dynamically the evolution of the ocean
around  southern Africa as a result of the activity of the Bouvet mantle plume.
A provisional animation is  available at the link [here](/).
