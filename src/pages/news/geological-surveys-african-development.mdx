The 34th International Geological Congress in Brisbane attracted almost 6000
delegates from all  over the world. Colin Reeves contributed a paper to the
special session on the role of geological  surveys in the development of
resources under the title: __Modern technology: opportunity or threat for failing
geological surveys?__ The talk was deliberately controversial and drew  supportive
reactions from African delegates who recognised the truth about the parlous
state of  many national geological surveys in Africa. A PDF file of the talk is
available upon request to  Earthworks. 

The abstract of the talk appears below. A longer, illustrated text on this topic
may be downloaded  via the item Earthworks 2001-2011 under the News tab above. 

> More than 40 years’ experience with geological surveys in Africa and elsewhere
> gives cause for concern over  their future. Technological change brings two
> powerful new tools to their function: (1) high resolution airborne
> geophysical surveys that can accelerate geological reconnaissance of whole
> countries and provide geoscience  data attractive to the global exploration
> industry; (2) ICT that makes virtually instantaneous map, data and  report
> distribution possible to desktops worldwide. Internet penetration has been
> undeniably tardy in Africa but  there has been little appetite so far for its
> exploitation as a means of publication and self-promotion by  geological
> surveys. Few have even a website that would pass muster by international
> norms. The main  obstacles, it seems, are operational or administrative rather
> than technical or scientific. Personal experience of  several hundred
> postgraduate students mostly from national geological surveys in the
> less-advantaged  countries is that the more capable quickly tire of the lack
> of career path on their return home and they then  become economic migrants or
> take premature retirement. The business model under which geological surveys
> operate is often punitive; ‘showing revenue’ is not a primary goal that would
> suit even the most successful of  western-style surveys. At another level,
> they often suffer the lack of efficiency and efficacy of a wider  government
> machine that fails its people more generally. Until things change, geological
> surveys risk both aid weariness on the part of donors and the rise of third
> parties elsewhere usurping the distribution of what should  be their sovereign
> data.
