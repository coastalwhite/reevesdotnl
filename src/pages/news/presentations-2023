Three years precisely after Covid-19 regulations put restrictions on public meetings, the fourth of four posters on our Gondwana work
will be presented in the 2023 Netherlands Geoscience Congress in Utrecht on March 23.  The title is **The Bouvet triple junction: a model of fragmentation in
Jurassic and Early Cretaceous times.** After many years of effort, we unveil a satisfactory model that accounts for the micro-fragments off southern Africa in 
the broader context of Gondwana dispersal as a whole.  In turn, this gives clearer insight into the way in which well-defined mature plate boundaries, such as
the present-day mid-ocean ridges in the South Atlantic and Indian oceans, evolve from the more chaotic rifting patterns of early continental disruption. The 
poster may be viewed here: [Reeves, 2023a](http://www.reeves.nl/upload/NAC2023-CVR.pdf)

A talk with the same title, **The Bouvet triple junction: a model of fragmentation in Jurassic and Early Cretaceous times,** will be given at the European 
Geoscience Union General Assembly in Vienna on 2023 April 20 in Session GD5.1, **Towards new understandings of complex continental margins and oceans**, 
Room -2.91, 09:55. The abstract of the talk is here [Reeves, 2023b](http://www.reeves.nl/upload/Abstract - The Bouvet triple junction.pdf).
