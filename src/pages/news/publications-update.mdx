There has not been much activity on this website recently but quite a lot of
material has been  published as extended abstracts and refereed publications in
the last 18 months. These items may  prove useful to those following
Gondwana-related research and exploration interests. The list  below summarises
what has appeared. I will do my best to provide copies in response to e-mail
requests.
