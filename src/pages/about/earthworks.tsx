        <Paragraph heading="The scientific basis of resource exploration">
          Systematic resource exploration starts with geological reconnaissance.
          Geological mapping was therefore a priority in many countries in the
          first half of the 20th century, underpinned by heroic campaigns of
          field mapping, supported in due course by the interpretation of aerial
          photography and then of satellite imagery in the second half of the
          century. The sheer size of areas to be covered in places like Africa
          is daunting and the problems of tedious land access are compounded by
          the paucity of bedrock exposure over large parts of most continents.
          The offshore continental margins, with their potential for oil and
          gas, offer virtually no conventional exposure.

          Since about 1950, airborne magnetometer surveys have shown their
          ability to offer fast geological reconnaissance of large areas at low
          cost, regardless of conditions on the ground. Such surveys evolved in
          their technological sophistication and had been joined by high
          resolution gamma-ray spectrometry by the 1990s. Airborne gravity has
          also gained its place amongst the most pertinent technologies to
          explore what lies at depth below large areas. The economic importance
          of extending geological mapping into these areas devoid of outcrop –
          and into the third dimension everywhere – is probably still
          underestimated by the earth science community at large. Geophysical
          mapping is relevant at scales from a map sheet to a continent. The
          procedures of ‘geophysical mapping’ are at the heart of Earthworks’
          experience. An introductory text-book, ‘Aeromagnetic Surveys:
          Principles, Practice and Interpretation’, <Link

          Thorough, intelligent and informed inventory of solid mineral and
          hydrocarbon prospectivity on land and at sea is essential both to the
          commercial resource sector and to national and international
          authorities. Despite their key economic role in this, many national
          geological surveys - in Africa, for example - are still starved of
          resources. Aid programmes attempting to compensate for decades of
          under-performance have routinely turned to airborne geophysical
          surveys to accelerate the national resource mapping process by
          providing pre-competitive baseline data to release to the exploration
          sector. Colin Reeves has been active in this sector for more than 50
          years.

          heading="A half-century of geophysical mapping and interpretation"
        >
          Our approach has been to face up to this challenge squarely, starting
          with the initial forays into the geology hidden below the sands of the
          Kalahari in Botswana. This evolved over many years into a focus on the
          key role of national geological surveys in collating, understanding
          and disseminating basic geological knowledge for their territories.
          Many international aid projects have supported economic exploration in
          this way. Wherever possible within these programmes Earthworks has
          sought to assist in institutional strengthening and capacity building.
          We argue that this starts with adopting a management strategy that is
          suited to the era of information and communication technology (ICT).
          ICT must now be at the core of any public sector survey organisation
          that is to remain effective as the custodian of the national
          geoscience database. We have repeatedly used management consultants
          versed in ‘the management of change’ to help achieve this within our
          projects.

        <Paragraph>
          The interpretation of regional geophysical surveys is a specialist
          skill that demands experienced practitioners. Pre-existing geological
          maps and knowledge must be the foundation of the work, but geophysical
          techniques always reveal hidden structures (such as the Okavango dyke
          swarm in Botswana) that not only allow interpolation and extrapolation
          of known geology into covered areas but also add the third dimension
          to hidden structures everywhere. The interpreter’s skill involves
          developing geological ideas that not only fit the observed geology but
          also make defensible arguments embracing the geophysical anomalies
          about what must lie below. It is fundamental to exploration programmes
          that such ideas suggest locations that can be tested in more-detailed
          exploration work at local scales.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          At the other end of the scale spectrum, from the broad perspective
          afforded by experience with national survey programmes in many
          countries of central, southern and eastern Africa, it is evident that
          geological correlations at continental scale drawing on these new
          national-scale insights, are under-developed. There is no
          continent-wide geological mapping authority in Africa to match the
          performance of, for example, Geoscience Australia, the Geological
          Survey of Canada or the USGS. With hands-on experience in so many
          countries of sub-Saharan Africa, this is one focus of the current
          endeavours of Earthworks. A better appreciation of the broader
          features of continental geology for Africa, in turn, allows the
          continent to be fitted more elegantly into larger entities of
          Precambrian rocks like Gondwana, Pangea and Rodinia.

        <Paragraph heading="The hidden two-thirds of the Earth">
          Most of our planet is covered by the water of the deep oceans. Their
          geological history was virtually unknown until the theory of plate
          tectonics brought a new dimension to earth science as a whole in the
          1960s. In 1997, satellite altimetry started to deliver images of
          sea-floor topography of startling resolution worldwide. The detail
          revealed was sufficient to interpret with confidence the processes of
          ocean creation within the guidelines of plate tectonic theory.

        <Paragraph>
          In combination with spherical geometry, the paths by which the
          continents dispersed from the Paleozoic entity of Gondwana could be
          traced with new accuracy over time. Making use of this data required
          the adoption of paleo-reconstruction software and postulating and
          evaluating continental movements that followed logical rules to
          produce models that were also satisfactory when viewed in animation.
          Slowly, satisfactory models of the dispersion of Gondwana were
          developed that bridged the Cretaceous Quiet Zone, devoid of the marine
          magnetic anomalies used universally to time ocean growth, and extended
          accurate reconstructions back into the Lower Cretaceous and Jurassic
          where the story of Gondwana disruption is rooted. This work is
          ongoing.

          With the luxury of a supply of available quality time, priority is now
          being given to these research activities, including support to the new
          Geological Map of Gondwana (IGCP-628). Earlier contributions to basic
          research have included, for example, the Magnetic Anomaly Map of the
          World, contributions to two scientific encyclopaedias and many
          workshops and training programmes. We are now particularly interested
          in cooperating with others with expertise, experience and
          non-confidential data (particularly in Africa) that can be shared with
          the wider earth science community to promote scientific knowledge of
          the geological past in the southern hemisphere.
