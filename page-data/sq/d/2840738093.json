The formation\nof Gondwana as a ‘supercontinent’ was completed at the start of Phanerozoic\ntimes, about 540 million years ago (540 Ma). It remained intact as a single\nlarge landmass for two-thirds of the time between then and now, eventually\nstarting to fragment in the Jurassic period, about 184 Ma. During Early\nCretaceous times, especially in the interval 140-120 Ma, most of the present\ncontinental outlines were established and these fragments started moving apart\nto give the familiar geography of today with almost half of the world’s oceans\nnow separating them. The research presented here has attempted to define step by\nstep the history of this dispersal against the geological time-scale and in\ngeometrical detail. While evidence of all sorts has been used, it is the careful\ninterpretation of the topography of the sea floor, revealed in detail by\nsatellite gravimetry only since about 1997, that has been key to this new\nunderstanding. The continental margins formed in the process - and the rifts\nthat have penetrated but not separated the present-day continents - are of\nimmense economic importance.
