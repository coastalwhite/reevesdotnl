The gravity work in Ngamiland was expanded to the idea of\nexecuting a  gravity survey of the whole country – the National Gravity Survey\nor ‘Natgrav’. This was carried  out between August 1972 and December 1973 with\nfinancial support from the UK Government.  The work was made up of three phases,\nnot necessarily in this order: (1) A network of national  base stations was\nneeded and 23 points were established by flying two Lacoste and Romberg\ngravimeters between these points and international base stations in Johannesburg\nand  Livingstone, Zambia. This took two weeks flying with Cessna aircraft Zulu\nGolf Charlie. (2) Then  there were the routine ground observations along all\nmotorable tracks at 10 km intervals – at an  average of about 8 new stations day\nto a total of about 2500 points. This was the bulk of the work  and took 18\nmonths and 45 000 km of driving.
